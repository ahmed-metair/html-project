<p>what is programing language?
<br>Aprogramming language is a computer language programmers use to develop software programs, scripts, or other sets of instructions for computers to execute.
<br>A programming language is a notation designed to connect instructions to a machine or a computer. Programming languages are mainly  used to control the performance of a machine or to express algorithms. At present, thousand programming languages have been implemented. In the computer field, many languages need to be stated in an imperative form, while other programming languages utilize declarative form. The program can be divided into two forms such as syntax and semantics. Some languages are defined by an SO standard like C language.
<p>any of various languages for expressing a set of detailed instructions for a digital computer. Such instructions can be executed directly when they are in the computer manufacturer-specific numerical form known as machine language, after a simple substitution process when expressed in a corresponding assembly language, or after translation from some “higher-level” language. Although there are many computer languages, relatively few are widely used.
<br>Machine and assembly languages are “low-level,” requiring a programmer to manage explicitly all of a computer’s idiosyncratic features of data storage and operation. In contrast, high-level languages shield a programmer from worrying about such considerations and provide a notation that is more easily written and read by programmers.

<p>the importance of programing languages.
<br>Programming language is important because it defines the relationship, semantics and grammar which allows the programmers to effectively communicate with the machines that they program
<br>You can instruct the computer what to do in a human-readable form
<br>Allows the programmer to structure the instructions into functions, procedures, etc.
<br>Computer programmers have a full understanding of the how and why of computer systems, including system limitations, and can set realistic expectations and work around those limitations to fully maximize the use of the equipment and its accessories.
<br>      Computer programming principles implemented today will likely influence how technologies such as voice-recognition, artificial intelligence and other sophisticated technologies will change in the future and how they will be applied to our day-to-day lives. For example, the trend toward automating Internet searches and purchases to be more localized is ongoing. While the hardware platforms developed will play a major role, computer technology will likely be at the center of it all and programming future systems will be an important aspect.
<br>Computer programmers have a full understanding of the how and why of computer systems, including system limitations, and can set realistic expectations and work around those limitations to fully maximize the use of the equipment and its accessories.
<br>No matter what type of job a computer programmer fulfills, he/she will have general responsibilities to perform in their role as computer programmer. The first is to develop new computer programming methods. These may include anywhere from basic computer programming methods to more in-depth methods. Another general responsibility which a computer programmer must undertake in his/her daily job role is the development of programs themselves. This is an extremely important concept associated with the role of a computer programmer as these are the individuals who construct the useful programs which are used by many.\
<p>What are diffrent Types of Programming Languages?
<br>The different types of programming languages are discussed below.
<p>Procedural Programming Language
<br>The procedural programming language is used to execute a sequence of statements which lead to a result. Typically, this type of programming language uses multiple variables, heavy loops and other elements, which separates them from functional programming languages. Functions of procedural language may control variables, other than function’s value  returns. For example, printing out information.
<p>Functional Programming Language
<br>Functional programming language typically uses stored data, frequently avoiding loops in favor of recursive functions.The functional programing’s  primary focus is on the return values of functions, and side effects and different suggests that storing state are powerfully discouraged. For example, in an exceedingly pure useful language, if a function is termed, it’s expected that the function not modify or perform any o/p. It may, however, build algorithmic calls and alter the parameters of these calls. Functional languages are usually easier and build it easier to figure on abstract issues, however, they’ll even be “further from the machine” therein their programming model makes it difficult to know precisely, but the code is decoded into machine language (which are often problematic for system programming).
<p>Object-oriented Programming Language
<br>This programming language  views the world as a group of objects that have internal data and external accessing parts of that data. The aim this programming language  is to think about the fault by separating it into a collection of objects that offer services which can be used to solve a specific problem. One of the main principle of object oriented programming language  is encapsulation that everything an object will need must be inside of the object. This language also emphasizes reusability through inheritance and the capacity to spread current implementations without having to change a great deal of code by using polymorphism.
<p>Scripting Programming Language
<br>These programming languages are often procedural and may comprise object-oriented language elements, but they fall into their own category as they are normally not full-fledged programming languages with support for development of large systems. For example, they may not have compile-time type checking. Usually, these languages require tiny syntax to get started.
<p>Logic Programming Language
<br>These types of languages let programmers  make declarative statements and then allow the machine to reason about the consequences of those statements. In a sense, this language doesn’t tell the computer how to do something, but employing restrictions on what it must consider doing.
